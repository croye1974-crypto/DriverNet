## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The application prioritizes a native mobile app aesthetic with a light gray background, subtle shadow-based elevation, and clean headers. Spacing is optimized for mobile list density, and bottom navigation uses larger icons. The design maintains a minimalist approach with clean surfaces, native spacing, typography, and a system font stack.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React 18 (TypeScript), Wouter, TanStack Query (v5), Shadcn UI + Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, React Hook Form with Zod. Supports dark/light themes.
- **Backend**: Express.js (TypeScript), in-memory storage (MemStorage) for MVP, RESTful endpoints with Zod validation.
- **Shared**: Drizzle ORM schemas with Zod for type-safe contracts.
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket integration for instant driver location updates and proactive notifications.
- **Geolocation**: GPS tracking, Haversine formula for driver matching (within 10 miles), postcodes.io for UK postcode lookup.

  - POST `/api/ai/summary`: Generates AI-powered text summaries with meet-up window suggestions
- Algorithms:
  - Nearest-neighbor route optimization for minimal total distance
  - Haversine distance calculations (miles) with peak-hour traffic adjustments
  - Logistic regression for driver density scoring (0-1 scale)
  - Polyline encoding/decoding for route visualization
  - Bearing calculations for directional matching

  - Fetches user: `/api/users/user-1`
  - Fetches schedules: `/api/schedules/user/user-1`
  - Filters to find schedule for selected date
  - Fetches jobs: `/api/jobs/schedule/{scheduleId}`
  - No session authentication required (eliminates 401 errors)
- Impact: Drivers can optimize complex multi-stop routes, identify high-density areas for lift sharing, and plan strategic meet-up windows

### AI Route Planner Bug Fix (October 2025)
- Issue: AI Route Planner showed "Nothing to optimise" despite jobs being present
- Root Cause: Original implementation used session-based authentication (`/api/user`, `/api/jobs?date={date}`) which failed in some contexts
- Solution: Refactored to use same URL-based pattern as Schedule and Profile pages
- Changes:
  - Added `currentUserId = "user-1"` mock constant (consistent with other pages)
  - User query: `/api/user` ‚Üí `/api/users/user-1`
  - Jobs query: `/api/jobs?date={date}` ‚Üí `/api/schedules/user/user-1` + `/api/jobs/schedule/{scheduleId}`
  - Added debug logging for user, schedules, currentSchedule, jobs
- Verification: End-to-end test with 2 jobs (Manchester‚ÜíLiverpool, Liverpool‚ÜíBirmingham) successfully optimized route showing 109.8 miles, 2h 25m drive time
- Impact: AI Route Planner now works reliably in all contexts (browser, Playwright tests, PWA mode)
