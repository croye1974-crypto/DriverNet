## Data Model

### Current Schema
- **Users**: Driver profiles with authentication
- **Lifts**: Offered rides with routes and availability
- **Requests**: Lift requests from drivers needing rides
- **Messages**: Direct messaging between drivers

### GPS & Scheduling Extensions (In Progress)
- **Schedules**: Daily job schedules with locations
- **Jobs**: Individual delivery jobs with locations
- **Locations**: GPS coordinates and addresses
- **Check-ins**: Track driver progress through jobs
- **Routes**: Calculated routes with time estimates

## Key Dependencies
- `@tanstack/react-query`: Data fetching and caching
- `wouter`: Lightweight routing
- `drizzle-orm`: Type-safe ORM
- `zod`: Schema validation
- `lucide-react`: Icon library
- `react-hook-form`: Form management
- Leaflet (to be installed): Map visualization

## Development Workflow
- Run `npm run dev` to start both frontend and backend
- Frontend: Vite dev server with HMR
- Backend: Express server with tsx watch mode
- All served on same port via Vite middleware

## User Preferences
- Mobile-first design prioritized
- GPS accuracy critical for driver matching
- Quick job check-in/out essential for workflow
- Map view preferred over list for finding nearby drivers

## Recent Changes (October 15, 2025)

### Native Mobile App Design Overhaul âœ…
- âœ… Complete design transformation to traditional native mobile app aesthetics (iOS/Android)
  - Updated color system: light gray background (95%) instead of white for native app feel
  - Removed all card borders, using only subtle shadows (shadow-sm) for elevation
  - Tighter spacing between cards (space-y-2 = 8px) for app-like list density
  - Clean headers with bg-card backgrounds (white on gray) - no borders
  - Bottom navigation with shadow-lg instead of border, larger icons (h-6 w-6)
- âœ… Updated all pages to native app layout pattern:
  - FindLifts: Borderless driver cards, clean search header with bg-card
  - Schedule: Floating header with bg-card, tight job card spacing
  - Messages: Native messaging app aesthetic with bg-card headers
- âœ… Design guidelines updated with native mobile app principles
  - Minimal borders philosophy
  - Clean surfaces with subtle elevation
  - Native spacing and typography
  - System font stack (-apple-system, SF Pro, Roboto)

  - Date selector for viewing schedules for any day
  - Add delivery job dialog with GPS location capture
  - Job list showing pickup/delivery locations with status tracking
  - Job status flow: Pending â†’ In Progress â†’ Completed
  - Check-in/out buttons integrated with GPS capture
  - Comprehensive error handling and loading states
  - All interactive elements have test IDs for automated testing

### UK Postcode Lookup Integration
- âœ… Integrated postcodes.io API for UK postcode lookup
  - Free API, no authentication required

  - Refreshes to current time when dialog opens

### Automatic Driver Matching
- âœ… Implemented automatic driver matching system
  - Jobs now capture GPS location on check-in/check-out
  - Matching algorithm finds drivers within 10 miles (16.09km) using Haversine formula
  - API endpoint `/api/lift-requests/find-matches` with bounded parameters
  - UI component `MatchedDrivers` shows nearby drivers with distance, location, and contact options
  - Integrated into lift request cards with proper error/loading/success states
- âœ… Map view toggle added to Find Lifts page

### Bug Fixes & API Integration
- âœ… Fixed job creation validation to properly handle datetime inputs
  - Schema now uses `z.coerce.date()` for robust string-to-Date conversion

  - Cleaned up debug logging in AddJobDialog
- âœ… Integrated real messaging API replacing mock data
  - Messages page connects to `/api/conversations` and `/api/messages/between` endpoints
  - Added proper loading states during data fetch
  - Error states with user-friendly messages
  - Send message mutation with toast notifications on error

  - Client calculates distance using user's last known location
  - Only shows notifications for drivers within 16.09km (10 miles)
  - Notifications auto-dismiss after 10 seconds
  - Shows driver name, location, distance, and quick message button
- âœ… Added `/api/users/:userId/last-location` endpoint
  - Finds user's most recent check-in or check-out location
  - Used for proximity-based notification filtering
  - Refreshes every minute for up-to-date positioning
- âœ… WebSocket auto-reconnect with 3-second delay on disconnect
- âœ… Graceful degradation: shows all notifications if user location unavailable

### Lift Request Confirmation Flow
- âœ… Implemented confirmation dialog for lift requests
  - Click "Request Lift" opens AlertDialog with driver and route details
  - Shows driver name, from/to locations for verification
  - Cancel option to abort request without side effects
  - Confirm button sends request and triggers success feedback
- âœ… Visual feedback system for request status
  - Success toast displays with clear message after confirmation
  - Button updates to "Request Sent" (disabled) after successful request
  - State persists during session to prevent duplicate requests
  - All interactions properly tested with automated playwright tests

  - State preserved when switching between List and Map views
  - Smooth transitions and responsive interactions

### GPS Fallback System Fixes
- âœ… **AddJobDialog GPS improvements**
  - 15-second safety timeout prevents infinite "Getting Location..." state
  - Geolocation availability check for graceful degradation
  - Better error messages guide users to postcode lookup alternative

  - Added stable `data-testid` attributes (marker-offer-{id}, marker-request-{id})
  - Implemented dual event handling: "click tap" for mouse and touch
  - Added `touch-action: manipulation` CSS to prevent double-tap zoom
  - Set `tapTolerance: 20px` for "fat finger" tolerance
  
- âœ… **Improved accessibility**
  - Added `role="button"` for screen reader support
  - Added descriptive `aria-label` for each marker type
  - Added `tabindex="0"` for keyboard navigation
  - Set `riseOnHover: true` to bring tapped markers to front
  
- âœ… **Event propagation fixes**
  - `L.DomEvent.stopPropagation(e)` prevents map pan interference
  - `pointer-events: none` on SVG icons ensures touch hits parent div
  - Layer cleanup preserves tile layers while removing only markers/polylines
  - Verified tile persistence through all interactions

### Messages Page Enhancement
