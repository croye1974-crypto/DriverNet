What to keep or add

Core product
	•	Auth + roles: user, moderator, admin.
	•	Entitlements: gate all post, message, and live-location features behind subscription_status = active.
	•	Matching: keep lift offers and requests, add ETA and detour-time scoring.
	•	Privacy: only show precise live location after both parties accept a match. Before that, show coarse location.
	•	Abuse controls: report user, block user, mute conversations, rate users after a ride.
	•	Data expiry: auto expire offers and requests after a set window. Clean old location pings.

Subscriptions
	•	Stripe (or Paddle) for monthly plans. No marketplace payouts.
	•	Webhooks: checkout.session.completed, customer.subscription.updated, customer.subscription.deleted.
	•	DB fields on users: stripe_customer_id, subscription_status (trialing, active, past_due, canceled), current_period_end, plan_id.
	•	Middleware: check subscription_status == active before allowing create offer/request, open DMs, or enable live location.
	•	Customer Portal: link for cancel, change plan, update card. Reduces support load.
